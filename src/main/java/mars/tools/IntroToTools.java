            Hello!  This Tool does not do anything but you may use its source code as a starting point to build your own MARS Tool.

            A MARS Tool is a program listed in the MARS Tools menu.  It is launched when you select its menu item and typically interacts with executing MIPS programs to do something exciting and informative or at least interesting.

            The basic requirements for building a MARS Tool are:
              1. It must be a class that implements the MarsTool interface.  This has only two methods: 'String getName()' to return the name to be displayed in its Tools menu item, and 'void action()' which is invoked when that menu item is selected by the MARS user.
              2. It must be stored in the mars.tools package (in folder mars/tools)
              3. It must be successfully compiled in that package.  This normally means the MARS distribution needs to be extracted from the JAR file before you can develop your Tool.

            If these requirements are met, MARS will recognize and load your Tool into its Tools menu the next time it runs.

            The frame/dialog you are reading right now is an example of an AbstractMarsTool subclass.

            See the mars.tools.AbstractMarsTool API or the source code of existing tool/apps for further information.
