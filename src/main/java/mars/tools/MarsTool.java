/**
 * Interface for any tool that interacts with an executing MIPS program.
 * A qualifying tool must be a class in the Tools package that
 * implements the MarsTool interface, must be compiled into a .class file,
 * and its .class file must be in the same Tools folder as MarsTool.class.
 * Mars will detect a qualifying tool upon startup, create an instance
 * using its no-argument constructor and add it to its Tools menu.
 * When its menu item is selected, the {@link #launch()} method will be invoked.
 * <p>
 * A tool may receive communication from MIPS system resources
 * (registers or memory) by registering as an observer with
 * {@link mars.mips.hardware.Memory} and/or {@link mars.mips.hardware.Register} objects.
 * <p>
 * It may also communicate directly with those resources through their published methods,
 * provided any such communication is done using {@link mars.simulator.Simulator#changeState(Runnable)}.
