/**
 * An abstract class that provides generic components to facilitate implementation of
 * a MarsTool and/or stand-alone Mars-based application.  Provides default definitions
 * of both the action() method required to implement MarsTool and the go() method
 * conventionally used to launch a Mars-based stand-alone application. It also provides
 * generic definitions for interactively controlling the application.  The generic controls
 * for MarsTools are 3 buttons:  connect/disconnect to MIPS resource (memory and/or
 * registers), reset, and close (exit).  The generic controls for stand-alone Mars apps
 * include: button that triggers a file open dialog, a text field to display status
 * messages, the run-speed slider to control execution rate when running a MIPS program,
 * a button that assembles and runs the current MIPS program, a button to interrupt
 * the running MIPS program, a reset button, and an exit button.
