/**
 * This class provides functionality to bring external MARS tools into the MARS
 * system by adding them to its Tools menu.  This permits anyone with knowledge
 * of the MARS public interfaces, in particular of the Memory and Register
 * classes, to write applications which can interact with a MIPS program
 * executing under MARS.  The execution is of course simulated.  The
 * private method for loading tool classes is adapted from Bret Barker's
 * GameServer class from the book "Developing Games In Java".

     * This method is adapted from the loadGameControllers() method in Bret Barker's

     * "Developing Games in Java".  It was demo'ed to me by Otterbein student
     * Chris Dieterle as part of his Spring 2005 independent study of implementing a
     * networked multi-player game playing system.  Thanks Bret and Chris!
     *
     * Bug Fix 25 Feb 06, DPS: method did not recognize tools folder if its
     * absolute pathname contained one or more spaces (e.g. C:\Program Files\mars\tools).
     * Problem was, class loader's getResource method returns a URL, in which spaces
     * are replaced with "%20".  So I added a replaceAll() to change them back.
     *
     * Enhanced 3 Oct 06, DPS: method did not work if running MARS from a JAR file.
     * The array of files returned is null, but the File object contains the name
     * of the JAR file (using toString, not getName).  Extract that name, open it
     * as a ZipFile, get the ZipEntry enumeration, find the class files in the tools
     * folder, then continue as before.
