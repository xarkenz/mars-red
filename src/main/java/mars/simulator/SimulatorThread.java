        // A couple statements below were added for the purpose of assuring that when
        // "back stepping" is enabled, every instruction will have at least one entry
        // on the back-stepping stack.  Most instructions will because they write either
        // to a register or memory.  But "nop" and branches not taken do not.  When the
        // user is stepping backward through the program, the stack is popped and if
        // an instruction has no entry it will be skipped over in the process.  This has
        // no effect on the correctness of the mechanism but the visual jerkiness when
        // instruction highlighting skips such instructions is disruptive.  Current solution
        // is to add a "do nothing" stack entry for instructions that do no write anything.
        // To keep this invisible to the "simulate()" method writer, we
        // will push such an entry onto the stack here if there is none for this instruction
        // by the time it has completed simulating.  This is done by the IF statement
        // just after the call to the simulate method itself.  The BackStepper method does
        // the aforementioned check and decides whether to push or not.  The result
        // is a a smoother interaction experience.  But it comes at the cost of slowing
        // simulation speed for flat-out runs, for every MIPS instruction executed even
        // though very few will require the "do nothing" stack entry.  For stepped or
        // timed execution the slower execution speed is not noticeable.
        //
        // To avoid this cost I tried a different technique: back-fill with "do nothings"
        // during the backstepping itself when this situation is recognized.  Problem
        // was in recognizing all possible situations in which the stack contained such
        // a "gap".  It became a morass of special cases and it seemed every weird test
        // case revealed another one.  In addition, when a program
        // begins with one or more such instructions ("nop" and branches not taken),
        // the backstep button is not enabled until a "real" instruction is executed.
        // This is noticeable in stepped mode.
