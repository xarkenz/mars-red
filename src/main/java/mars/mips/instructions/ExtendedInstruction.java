     * <li>NRn means substitute next higher register than the one in nth token of source code
     * <li>OPn means substitute nth token of source code as is
     * <li>LLn means substitute low order 16 bits from label address in source token n.
     * <li>LLnU means substitute low order 16 bits (unsigned) from label address in source token n.
     * <li>LLnPm (m=1,2,3,4) means substitute low order 16 bits from label address in source token n, after adding m.
     * <li>LHn means substitute high order 16 bits from label address in source token n. Must add 1 if address bit 15 is 1.
     * <li>LHnPm (m=1,2,3,4) means substitute high order 16 bits from label address in source token n, after adding m. Must then add 1 if bit 15 is 1.

     * <li>VHLn means substitute high order 16 bits from 32 bit value in source token n.  Use this if later combined with low order 16 bits using "ori $1,$1,VLn". See logical and branch operations.
     * <li>VHn means substitute high order 16 bits from 32 bit value in source token n, then add 1 if value's bit 15 is 1.  Use this only if later instruction uses VLn($1) to calculate 32 bit address.  See loads and stores.

     * <li>LLP is similar to LLn, but is needed for "label+100000" address offset. Immediate is added before taking low order 16.
     * <li>LLPU is similar to LLnU, but is needed for "label+100000" address offset. Immediate is added before taking low order 16 (unsigned).
     * <li>LLPPm (m=1,2,3,4) is similar to LLP except m is added along with immediate before taking low order 16.
     * <li>LHPA is similar to LHn, but is needed for "label+100000" address offset. Immediate is added before taking high order 16.
     * <li>LHPN is similar to LHPA, used only by "la" instruction. Address resolved by "ori" so do not add 1 if bit 15 is 1.
     * <li>LHPAPm (m=1,2,3,4) is similar to LHPA except value m is added along with immediate before taking high order 16.
     * <li>LHL means substitute high order 16 bits from label address in token 2 of "la" (load address) source statement.
     * <li>LAB means substitute textual label from last token of source statement.  Used for various branches.
     * <li>S32 means substitute the result of subtracting the constant value in last token from 32.  Used by "ror", "rol".
     * <li>DBNOP means Delayed Branching NOP - generate a "nop" instruction but only if delayed branching is enabled. Added in 3.4.1 release.
     * <li>BROFFnm means substitute n if delayed branching is NOT enabled otherwise substitute m.  n and m are single digit numbers indicating constant branch offset (in words).  Added in 3.4.1 release.
