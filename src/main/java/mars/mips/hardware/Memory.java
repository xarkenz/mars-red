     * Class representing an arbitrary contiguous region of memory which contains data.
     * <p>
     * Obviously, allocating one array for the entire region of memory would be extremely wasteful
     * (and perhaps not even possible), so the region is divided into many fixed-size tables,
     * each of which is further subdivided into many blocks, a block being an array of memory words.
     * Currently, each block contains 1024 words, and each table contains 1024 blocks. Thus, each block
     * holds 4 KiB of data, and each table can accommodate up to 4 MiB of data in total.
     * <p>
     * Although this structure uses a three-dimensional array, this makes it relatively space-efficient since
     * only the outermost array of tables is allocated initially. Tables and blocks are only allocated
     * when a write occurs somewhere in their range; otherwise, they are simply left as null references.
     * In addition, the array of tables only has as many elements as is necessary to fully cover the region.
     * A base address is used as the memory offset of the first table in the array.
     * <p>
     * Sean Clarke (05/2024): The note below is interesting, but not really relevant. I'll keep it here for now.
     * <p>
     * The SPIM simulator stores statically allocated data (i.e. data following a <code>.data</code> directive)
     * starting at address <code>0x10010000</code>. This is the first word beyond the reach of <code>$gp</code>
     * used in conjunction with a signed 16-bit immediate offset. <code>$gp</code> has value <code>0x10008000</code>,
     * and with the signed 16-bit offset, it can reach from <code>0x10008000 - 0x8000 = 0x10000000</code>
     * (base of the data segment) to <code>0x10008000 + 0x7FFF = 0x1000FFFF</code>
