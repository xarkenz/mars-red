## Introduction

MARS Red includes an integrated text editor featuring syntax-aware color highlighting
of most MIPS language elements and popup instruction guidance.

Above the editor is a row of tabs, each representing an open file. Clicking on a tab
changes which file is displayed. The "✕" button on a tab can be used to close that tab.
Tabs can be reordered by simply clicking and dragging.

Below the editor is a status bar indicating the current line and column of the text cursor.

The color scheme of the editor, as well as several aspects of its behavior, can be
customized via the *Settings→Editor Settings* dialog.
