# Interface

The IDE is invoked when MARS Red is run with no command-line arguments
(e.g. `java -jar mars.jar`). It may also be launched from a graphical interface
by double-clicking the executable JAR file on some platforms.
It provides basic editing, assembly, execution, and debugging capabilities.
