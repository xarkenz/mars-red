Many menu actions have equivalent toolbar buttons.
If the function of an action is not obvious, just hover the mouse over it and
a tool tip will soon appear. Most menu actions also have keyboard shortcuts.
Any menu action that is not applicable to the current state is disabled.

Full list of actions and their descriptions coming soon.
