# **MARS Red**

MIPS Assembler and Runtime Simulator

MARS Red is a modern derivative of [MARS](https://dpetersanderson.github.io/)
(MIPS Assembler and Runtime Simulator), a lightweight IDE for programming in the MIPS assembly language.
The original MARS was developed by Dr. Pete Sanderson and Dr. Kenneth Vollmar.
Both have since retired, leaving MARS without any updates since 2014.
For more information about the original MARS, see [History](history/).

The MARS Red IDE provides editing and assembling capabilities, but its real
strength lies in its support for interactive debugging. The programmer can easily add or 
remove execution breakpoints after assembling, execute the program in slow motion or
one instruction at a time, undo instructions, and view and directly edit registers
and data in memory while the program is running.
